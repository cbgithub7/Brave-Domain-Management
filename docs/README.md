## 1. Introduction

The **Domain Manager** is a tool designed to facilitate the management of domain entries in the Windows registry. It provides a set of functionalities to add, remove, and fetch domain entries, as well as check the status of the registry path and Brave browser installation.

### Purpose

The primary purpose of the Domain Manager is to simplify the process of managing domain entries in the Windows registry. This is particularly useful for administrators or users who need to maintain a list of blocked or allowed domains for various purposes, such as security or content filtering.

### Importance of Managing Domain Entries

Managing domain entries in the Windows registry is necessary for several reasons:

- **Security**: Blocking or allowing specific domains can enhance security by preventing access to malicious websites or restricting access to approved ones.
- **Content Filtering**: Organizations may need to filter internet access based on domain names to enforce acceptable use policies or comply with regulatory requirements.
- **Application Control**: Some applications use the Windows registry to store domain-based configurations or restrictions, and managing these entries is essential for proper application functionality.

Overall, the Domain Manager simplifies the task of managing domain entries in the Windows registry, providing users with a convenient and efficient way to maintain control over internet access and application behavior.
